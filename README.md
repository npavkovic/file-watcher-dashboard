# AI-Enhanced File Watcher Dashboard

Monitors one or more directories on your machine, generates AI-powered summaries & tags for every file (and folder), and serves a lightweight web UI for browsing, searching, and editing Markdown in-place.

---

## Quick Start (Development)

```bash
# Node 20 LTS recommended
nvm install 20 && nvm use 20

# install dependencies
npm install

# copy sample config & edit watch paths
cp watcher.paths.sample.json watcher.paths.json
# Edit watcher.paths.json with your directories

# run both the watcher and web server in dev mode
npm run dev
```

The server starts on **http://localhost:3000** and immediately indexes the directories listed in `watcher.paths.json`.
