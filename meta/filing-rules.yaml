    FEATURE_BRIEF: High-level feature proposals, product ideas, capability descriptions
    TECHNICAL_SPEC: Detailed technical specifications, implementation plans, architecture documents
    BUG_REPORT: Bug descriptions, error reports, issue documentation
    RESEARCH: Research findings, analysis, investigations, background information
    DOCUMENTATION: User guides, API docs, README files, how-to guides
    TEST_FILE: Test cases, test data, quality assurance documents
    CONFIG: Configuration files, settings, environment specifications
    BLOG_IDEA: Blog post ideas, content proposals, writing drafts
    MEETING_NOTES: Meeting summaries, discussion notes, decision records
    TODO_ITEM: Task lists, action items, work planning documents
